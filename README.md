# Thesis

These are the organized codes for data construction and regression in my master's thesis.

The research sample selected for this study consists of manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in China from 2000 to 2016. The basic and financial data of these companies are sourced from the CSMAR database.
The data for standard harmonization events primarily come from the voluntary standard harmonization dataset constructed by Schmidt and Steingress (2022).

This paper quantifies a novel channel that contributes to the greening of Global Value Chains (GVCs): the harmonization of voluntary product standards across countries as the micro-level dimension of institutional openness. I construct an asymmetric two-sided GVC model that displays three mechanisms through which standard harmonization impacts GVC greenness. Using firm-level trade data and a two-way fixed-effects model, I create a novel proxy—the carbon emission intensity of domestic value-added—to measure GVC greenness, and confirm that standard harmonization generates demand effects, cost complementarity effects, and technological effects. Firms with relatively low foreign value-added in exports, in highcarbon industries, and primarily engaged in export trade benefit significantly from standard openness.
